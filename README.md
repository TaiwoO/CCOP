## Getting started

1. Begin with a fresh install of a debian-based linux distribution (Mint/Ubuntu/Kali)
2. Run setup.sh to install necessary dependencies and create virtual python environment
3. Run db_create.py to create the database
4. Run scrapedata.py to pull data from the endpoints into the database (only crime works currently)
