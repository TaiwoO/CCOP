# UMBC_Spr17_TeamPlusPlus

## Getting started

1. Begin with a fresh install of a debian-based linux distribution (Mint/Ubuntu/Kali)
2. Run setup.sh to install necessary dependencies and create virtual python environment
3. Run "source ccop_dev/bin/activate" to activate the virtual python environment
4. Run db_create.py to create the database and set up the tables
5. Run scrapedata.py to pull data from the endpoints into the database (only crime works currently)
